# Detection-and-Response-Lab
### Objective

During my Detection and Response lab, I gained hands-on training experience in identifying and responding to cybersecurity threats through practical, sceneeio-based exercises. I learned how to use industry standard tools such as SIEMs, intrusion detection systems, and log analysis platforms to detect suspicious activities across networks and endpoints. This lab helped me understand how how to simulate cyber-attacks and monitor the system behavior, giving me practical insight into how real-world threats unfold. I also developed skills in analyzing alerts, correlating events from multiple sources, and conducting threat hunting using logs data. Most importantly, I learned how to respond to incidents by applying containment, eradication, and recovery strategies, as well as how to document and report findings clearly and professionally. This experience deepened my confidence in threat detection and incident response and act decisively during potential security breaches.

### Skills Learned

- I learned how to detect suspicious activities by analyzing security logs from endpoints and network devices.
- I became comfortable using tools like Splunk, Suricata and Google chronicle and log forwarders to monitor and investigate threats.
- I practiced simulating attacks such as phising, brute-force and priviledge escalation to undestand how threat behave.
- I gained hands-on experience in threat hunting, using logs data to proactively identify potential risks.
- I applied key incident response strategies including containment, eradication and recovery.
- I improved my documentation skills by recording investigation steps and summarizing findings clearly.
- I strengthened my critical thinking and decision making skills in high pressure scenerios.
- Overall, I became more confident in my ability to detect, analyze and respond to cybersecurity threats

### Tools Used

- Splunk - Used for log aggregation, searching and analyzing security events.
- Suricata - Deployed as an intrusion detection and preventon system (IDS/IPS) to monitor network traffic.
- Log Forwarder - Used to forward logs from endpoints to analysis tools like Splunk and Chronicle.
- Wireshark - Apllied for analyzing packet captures and examing network traffic during simulated attacks.
- Google Chronicle - Utilized scalable security analytics and threat detection
